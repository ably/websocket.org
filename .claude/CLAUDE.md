## IMPORTANT: Project Guidelines

Before performing ANY tasks in this repository, you MUST read and follow the
guidelines in `AGENTS.md` in the project root.

The AGENTS.md file contains:

- Critical pre-commit checklist (linting, formatting, testing)
- Known issues and their solutions
- Repository structure and standards
- WebSocket-specific implementation guidelines
- Quality gates that must be met

Always consult AGENTS.md first to ensure all work meets the project's quality
standards.
