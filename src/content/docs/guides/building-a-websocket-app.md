This post provides detailed, step-by-step instructions on building a realtime
web app with WebSockets and Node.js - an interactive cursor position-sharing
demo. Building a WebSocket application from scratch provides valuable insights
into the underlying mechanics of real-time communication, helping developers
understand the challenges and considerations involved in creating responsive,
interactive web experiences.

The cursor-sharing demo we'll build represents a common pattern in modern web
applications: real-time collaborative features where multiple users can see each
other's actions simultaneously. This type of functionality forms the foundation
for more complex collaborative tools like shared whiteboards, collaborative
document editing, multiplayer games, and real-time dashboards. Understanding how
to implement basic position tracking and broadcasting provides the groundwork
for more sophisticated real-time features.

## Running the Demo

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/ably-labs/WebSockets-cursor-sharing.git
> npm install
> npm run start
```

This demo includes two applications: a web app that we serve through
[Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/), and a Node.js web server. The NPM start
task spins up both the API and the web server.

The architecture follows a typical client-server model where the frontend
handles user interactions and cursor position tracking, while the backend
manages WebSocket connections and message broadcasting. Snowpack serves as our
development server, providing fast builds and hot module replacement for a
smooth development experience. The separation between the client application and
the WebSocket server demonstrates how real-time functionality can be integrated
into existing web applications without requiring a complete architectural
overhaul.

The demo should look as depicted below:

However, if you are running the demo in a browser that does not support
WebSockets (e.g., IE9 or below), or if you are restricted by particularly tight
corporate proxies, you will get an error saying that the browser can't establish
a connection:

can't be established_

This is because the ws library offers no fallback transfer protocols if
WebSockets are unavailable. If this is a requirement for your project, or you
want to have a higher level of reliability of delivery for your messages, then
you will need a library that offers multiple transfer protocols, such as SockJS.

The limitation of native WebSocket implementations highlights an important
consideration in real-world application development: not all environments
support WebSockets equally. Corporate firewalls, proxy servers, and legacy
network infrastructure can block WebSocket connections, while older browsers may
lack WebSocket support entirely. This creates a significant reliability gap that
can affect user experience in production environments. For applications that
need to reach the widest possible audience or operate in restrictive network
environments, implementing fallback mechanisms becomes essential rather than
optional. For an analysis of current WebSocket support and whether you still
need fallbacks in 2024, see
[this detailed evaluation](https://ably.com/blog/websocket-compatibility).

## SockJS — a JavaScript library to provide WebSocket-like communication

SockJS is a library that mimics the native WebSocket API in browsers.
Additionally, it will fall back to HTTP whenever a WebSocket fails to connect,
or if the browser being used doesn't support WebSockets. Like ws, SockJS
requires a server counterpart; its maintainers provide both a
[JavaScript client library](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client), and a
[Node.js server library](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-node).

Using SockJS in the client is similar to the native WebSocket API, with a few
small differences. We can swap out ws in the demo built previously and use
SockJS instead to include fallback support.

### Updating the interactive cursor position sharing demo to use SockJS

To use SockJS in the client, we first need to load the SockJS JavaScript library
from their CDN. In the head of the index.html document we built earlier, add the
following line above the script include of index.js:

```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sockjs-client@1/dist/sockjs.min.js"
  defer
></script>
```

Note the `defer` keyword — it ensures that the SockJS library is loaded before
index.js runs.

In the app/script.js file, we then update the JavaScript to use SockJS. Instead
of the WebSocket object, we'll now use a SockJS object. Inside the
connectToServer function, we'll establish the connection with the SockJS server:

```javascript
const ws = new SockJS('http://localhost:7071/ws');
```

SockJS requires a prefix path on the server URL. The rest of the app/script.js
file requires no change.

Next, we have to update the API/script.js file to make our server use SockJS.
This means changing the names of a few event hooks, but the API is very similar
to ws.

First, we need to install sockjs-node. In your terminal run:

```bash
> npm install sockjs
```

Then we need to require the sockjs module and the built-in HTTP module from
Node. Delete the line that requires ws and replace it with the following:

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const sockjs = require('sockjs');
```

We then change the declaration of wss to become:

```javascript
const wss = sockjs.createServer();
```

At the very bottom of the API/index.js file we'll create the HTTPS server and
add the SockJS HTTP handlers:

```javascript
const server = http.createServer();
wss.installHandlers(server, { prefix: '/ws' });
server.listen(7071, '0.0.0.0');
```

We map the handlers to a prefix supplied in a configuration object ('/ws'). We
tell the HTTP server to listen on port 7071 (arbitrarily chosen) on all the
network interfaces on the machine.

The final job is to update the event names to work with SockJS:

```javascript
// ws.on('message', /* ... */) will become ws.on('data', /* ... */)
// client.send(outbound);      will become client.write(outbound);
```

And that's it, the demo will now run with WebSockets where they are supported;
and where they aren't, it will use Comet long polling. This latter fallback
option will show a slightly less smooth cursor movement, but it is more
functional than no connection at all!

## Running the demo with SockJS

If you've been following along with the tutorial, then you can run:

```bash
> npm install
> npm run start
```

If not, you can clone a working version of the demo from:
https://github.com/ably-labs/websockets-cursor-sharing/tree/sockjs.

```bash
> git clone -b sockjs https://github.com/ably-labs/WebSockets-cursor-sharing.git
> npm install
> npm run start
```

This demo includes two applications: a web app that we serve through
[Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/), and a Node.js web server. The NPM start
task spins up both the API and the web server.

The demo should look as depicted below:

## Scaling the web app

You might notice that in both examples we're storing the state in the Node.js
WebSocket server — there is a Map that keeps track of connected WebSockets and
their associated metadata. This means that for the solution to work, and for
every user to see one another, they have to be connected to the same WebSocket
server.

The number of active users you can support is thus directly related to how much
hardware your server has. Node.js is pretty good at managing concurrency, but
once you reach a few hundred to a few thousand users, you're going to need to
scale your hardware to keep all the users in sync.

Scaling vertically is often an expensive proposition, and you'll always be faced
with a performance ceiling of the most powerful piece of hardware you can
procure. Additionally, vertical scaling is not elastic, so you have to do it
ahead of time. You should consider horizontal scaling, which is better in the
long run — but also significantly more difficult. Ably has a good architectural
document explaining how they have approached
[vertical vs horizontal scalability for WebSockets](https://ably.com/docs/platform/architecture/platform-scalability).'

## What makes WebSockets hard to scale?

WebSockets are fundamentally hard to scale because connections to your WebSocket
server need to be persistent. And even once you've scaled your server layer, you
also need to provide a solution for sharing data between the nodes. Connection
state needs to be stored out-of-process — this usually involves using something
like [Redis](https://redis.io/), or a traditional database, to ensure that all
the nodes have the same view of state.

The persistent nature of WebSocket connections creates unique challenges that
don't exist with traditional HTTP request-response patterns. Each WebSocket
connection maintains state on the server, consuming memory and processing
resources even when idle. This stateful nature means that load balancing becomes
more complex - you can't simply round-robin requests across servers as you would
with stateless HTTP traffic. Instead, you need sticky sessions or more
sophisticated routing mechanisms to ensure that clients can maintain their
connections and receive all relevant messages.

Moreover, when scaling horizontally, the challenge of message broadcasting
becomes exponentially more complex. In our simple cursor-sharing demo,
broadcasting a cursor position to all connected clients is straightforward when
they're all connected to the same server. However, when clients are distributed
across multiple servers, you need a message bus or pub/sub system to ensure that
messages from one server reach clients connected to other servers. This
inter-server communication adds latency and complexity to your architecture,
requiring careful design to maintain the real-time performance that WebSockets
are meant to provide.

In addition to having to share state using additional technology, broadcasting
to all subscribed clients becomes difficult, because any given WebSocketServer
node knows only about the clients connected to itself.

There are multiple ways to solve this: either by using some form of direct
connection between the cluster nodes that are handling the traffic, or by using
an external pub/sub mechanism. This is sometimes called "adding a backplane" to
your infrastructure, and is yet another moving part that makes
[scaling WebSockets](https://ably.com/topic/the-challenge-of-scaling-websockets)
difficult.

See [WebSockets at Scale](/websockets-at-scale/) for a more in-depth read about
the engineering challenges involved in scaling WebSockets. For production
applications, you might want to consider using a realtime platform like
[Ably](https://ably.com/) that is
[architected for scaling WebSockets](https://ably.com/docs/platform/architecture/platform-scalability).
