## WebSockets: The WebSocket protocol and API explained

WebSocket is a realtime technology that enables bidirectional, full-duplex communication between client and server over a persistent, single-socket connection. The WebSocket connection is kept alive for as long as needed (in theory, it can last forever), allowing the server and the client to send data at will, with minimal overhead.

The WebSocket technology consists of two core building blocks:

1. The WebSocket protocol.
2. The WebSocket API.
